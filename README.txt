Implementation of PI controller with feedforward signal, stabilizing the system and performing the desired actions by generating trajectory using cubic polynomial time scaling method. Making use of the trajectory data which is sent to controller and error is calculated based on the difference. Error is eliminated or mostly reduced to minimal. Final trajectory is generated in a csv file which is called upon the vrep simulation scenario.
Input data given are initial configuration of the cube to be picked, final configuration of cube that is desired and initial configuration of the robot states. Kinematics is used to find the updated states based  on time step given. 
Youbot control calculates the error difference in desired and generated trajectory solutions. Based on this error feedback signal, controller gains are multiplied to improve the solution. Final trajectroy is obtained as csv file in output along with a file with error data. Youbotcontrol funnction is called to obtain the solution with input data, other functions are called inside of this function. Namely Feedback control, trajectory generator and nextstate, these funcitons generates trajectory using cubic time scaling states at different time steps are obtained. All of these states are compared with next state which is calculated based on kinematics of the robot. The states are updated and final trajectory is generated and sent to the file for further investigation.
